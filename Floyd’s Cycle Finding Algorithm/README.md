Floydâ€™s cycle finding algorithm or Hare-Tortoise algorithm is a pointer algorithm that uses only two pointers, moving through the sequence at different speeds. This algorithm is used to find a loop in a linked list. It uses two pointers one moving twice as fast as the other one. The faster one is called the fast pointer and the other one is called the slow pointer.
