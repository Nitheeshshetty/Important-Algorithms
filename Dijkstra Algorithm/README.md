Dijkstra algorithm is one of the prominent algorithms to find the shortest path from the source node to a destination node. It uses the greedy approach to find the shortest path. The concept of the Dijkstra algorithm is to find the shortest distance (path) starting from the source point and to ignore the longer distances while doing an update.
