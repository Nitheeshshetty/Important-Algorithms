Dijkstra algorithm is one of the prominent algorithms to find the shortest path from the source node to a destination node. It uses the greedy approach to find the shortest path. The concept of the Dijkstra algorithm is to find the shortest distance (path) starting from the source point and to ignore the longer distances while doing an update.It is important to note that Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is only applicable when all weights are positive because, during the execution, the weights of the edges are added to find the shortest path.
