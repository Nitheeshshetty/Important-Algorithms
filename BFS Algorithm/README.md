The breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm is used to search a tree or graph data structure for a node that meets a set of criteria. It starts at the treeâ€™s root or graph and searches/visits all nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Breadth-first search can be used to solve many problems in graph theory.Graphs may contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again. To avoid processing a node more than once, we divide the vertices into two categories i.e Visited and Not visited.A boolean visited array is used to mark the visited vertices.

Follow the below steps to implement BFS traversal :
---------------------------------------------------
    1. Declare a queue and insert the starting vertex.
    2. Initialize a visited array and mark the starting vertex as visited.
    3. Follow the below process till the queue becomes empty:
        ->Remove the first vertex of the queue.
        ->Mark that vertex as visited.
        ->Insert all the unvisited neighbors of the vertex into the queue.
